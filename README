NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::Adapter - Wrap any simple class as a service for
    Dancer2

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
      # in config.yml

      plugins:
        Adapter:
          ua:
            class: HTTP::Tiny
            scope: request
            options:
              max_redirect: 3

      # in your app

      use Dancer2::Plugin::Adapter;

      get '/proxy/:url' => sub {
        my $res = service('ua')->get( params->{'url'} );
        if ( $res->{success} ) {
          return $res->{content};
        }
        else {
          template 'error' => { response => $res };
        }
      };

DESCRIPTION
    The problem: you want to use some perl class in your Dancer2 app, but
    there's no plugin for it.

    The solution: as long as the class needs only static data to construct
    an object, then "Dancer2::Plugin::Adaptor" can do the wrapping for you.
    Think of it as a "just-in-time" plugin (or maybe a poor-man's
    Bread::Board).

    Here's another example: you want to send emails via Postmark
    <http://postmarkapp.com> using WWW::Postmark.

    In your config.yml, you put this:

      plugins:
        Adapter:
          postmark:
            class: WWW::Postmark
            scope: singleton
            options: POSTMARK_API_TEST

    In your production config.yml, you can replace 'POSTMARK_API_TEST' with
    your real Postmark API key.

    Then, in your application, here's how you use it:

        get '/' => sub {
          eval {
            service("postmark")->send(
              from    => 'me@domain.tld',
              to      => 'you@domain.tld, them@domain.tld',
              subject => 'an email message',
              body    => "hi guys, what's up?"
            );
          };

          return $@ ? "Error: $@" : "Mail sent";
        };

    "Dancer2::Plugin::Adapter" takes care of constructing and caching the
    WWW::Postmark object based on the configuration data, and lets you
    access the object with the "service()" function.

CONFIGURATION
    One or more objects are defined by "NAME => HASHREF" pairs. The hash
    reference for each NAME must contain a 'class' key, whose value is the
    class to wrap.

    The 'scope' key determines how long the generated object persists. The
    choice of scope will depend on whether the object holds onto any state
    that should not last across requests. The following scope values are
    allowed:

    *   "request" -- (default) the object persists in the "vars" hash for
        the duration of the request

    *   "singleton" -- the objects persists in a private, lexical hash for
        the duration of the process

    *   "none" -- the object is not cached; a fresh object is created on
        each call

    If the hash reference contains an 'options' key, its value will be
    dereferenced (if it is a hash or array reference) and passed to "new()"
    when the object is created. Note that if the class requires a reference
    for the constructor, you have to wrap it in an extra array. E.g.

      # config.yml:
      plugins:
        Adapter:
          foo:
            class: Foo::Bar
            scope: request 
            options:
              -
                wibble: wobble
                biff: boff

      # constructor called as:
      Foo::Bar->new( { wibble => wobble, biff => boff } );

    If the class does not use 'new' as the name of its constructor, an
    alternate can be specified with the 'constructor' key.

      # config.yml:
      plugins:
        Adapter:
          tmpdir:
            class: File::Temp
            constructor: newdir

      # constructor called as:
      File::Temp->newdir()

    When caching under "request" scope, Dancer2::Plugin::Adaptor uses the
    key "_dpa" in the "vars".

USAGE
  service
      $object = service($name);

    This function returns the object corresponding to the name defined in
    the configuration file. The object is created on demand and may be
    cached for future use based on its "scope" configuration option.
